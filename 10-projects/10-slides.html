# Why I replaced MIT with copyleft license for Nodemailer

### "In short, that’s why I decided to change the license. I don’t feel like I should be sponsoring big companies with my unpaid time. I can’t (and I don’t want to) revert already published versions but for the new stuff I go with copyleft. For most people this should be just as fine as anything else. If, for whatever reason, copyleft is not acceptable, then there’s always the option to purchase a commercial license without the limitations of copyleft or use something else to send the emails, for example vendor provided API clients or some other SMTP client."

# What to Work On

background-image: url(images/graham.png)

background-image: url(images/grahamhow.png)

# "Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has... I made it myself." - PG

---
# "A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already existed." - PG

# A.I.: Relative to the potential impact, it doesn’t seem like enough smart people are working on this.

--

# ROBOTICS: Robots will be a major way we get things done in the physical world.
---
# EDUCATION: If we can fix education, we can eventually do everything else on this list.

--

# HUMAN AUGMENTATION: We like companies that try to augment humans.

--

# DIVERSITY: A diverse workforce is good for business and good for the world. 
---
# VR AND AR: Virtual reality and augmented reality have been a long-unfulfilled promise.

--

# PROGRAMMING TOOLS: Software developers are shaping more and more of our daily lives. The products they use to make software are a powerful lever: they have a dramatic impact on the quality and kind of software being built.



---
# ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE: Software used by large companies is still awful and still very lucrative.

--

## Making The Expensive Cheap
## The Next Billion Workers
## Digitizing Every Industry

---
# FINANCIAL SERVICES: The world’s financial systems are increasingly unable to meet the demands of consumers and businesses.

--

# COMPUTER SECURITY: Securing computers is difficult because the work required is so asymmetric – the attacker

---
# IMPROVING DEMOCRACY: There are thousands of ways technology can be applied to improve democracy.

--

# NEWS: We need accurate, unbiased press to make our democracy work.

# Sam Altman On What To Work On

## I think the best way to pick what you want to do is to find the intersection of what you’re good at, what you enjoy, what the world needs, and what the world values.

---
# Sam Altman On What To Work On
## It’s not easy to figure out what you actually care about– there are so many directions you can go. But rather than listening to where other people might push you, it’s worth trying to figure this out for yourself. Don’t chase other people’s ideas of what matters. The best way to succeed long-term is to deeply believe that what you’re doing matters.

---
# Sam Altman On What To Work On
## Most people just fall into things that come their way. That can work – people sometimes just have to try stuff to figure out what they like – but I think it’s worth being more deliberate. Try to develop and carefully refine strong convictions about what you want to accomplish.

---
# Sam Altman On What To Work On
## The framework I’ve found most useful for helping people think through career decisions is to consider both impact maximization and regret minimization—a decision that scores well on both is likely to be a good one.

---
# Our goal: make a meaningful contribution to an existing open source project

# How do you find a project to contribute to?
