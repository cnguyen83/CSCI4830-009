## Defining Open Source Software...

## Defining **Free** Open Source Software...

--

# Free as in...

--

#### ... free beer

--

#### ... free speech

--

#### ... access

--

#### ... over time

--

#### ... not closed

--

#### ... reuse

--

#### ... change

--

#### ... any user

--

#### ... any contributor

---
class: center, middle

## **When we call software “free,” we mean that it respects the users' essential freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. This is a matter of freedom, not price, so think of “free speech,” not “free beer.”** - RMS

# Copyleft

## FOSS License that is Viral to Derivative Works

# "The essays in this book did not invent such a fundamental advance, but they do describe one: open-source software, the process of systematically harnessing open development and decentralized peer review to lower costs and improve software quality."

## "The hacker culture and its successes pose by example some fundamental questions about human motivation, the organization of work, the future of professionalism, and the shape of the firm -- and about how all of these things will change and evolve in the information-rich post-scarcity economies of the 21st century and beyond. The hacker culture also, arguably, prefigures some profound changes in the way humans will relate to and reshape their economic surroundings. This should make what we know about the hacker culture of interest to anyone else who will have to live and work in the future."

# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

.center[# 1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.]

---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

.right[# 2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).]


---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 3. Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow.

### "One thing about open source is that even the failures contribute to the next thing that comes up. Unlike a company that could spend a million dollars in two years and fail and there's nothing really to show for it, if you spend a million dollars on open source, you probably have something amazing that other people can build on." -Matt Mullenweg

---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.

---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.

---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.

### "I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually do." - Linus Torvald

# Linus

### ***The big point for me really was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little. The big point for me was not being alone and having ten, maybe 100 people being involved. That was a big point. Then everything else was very gradual. Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal, to me. Well maybe it is if you want to sell your result, it’s a huge deal, don’t get me wrong. But if you’re interested in the technology and you’re interested in the project, the big part was getting the community. Then the community grew gradually, and there’s actually not a single point where I went like, “Wow that just took off,” because it, I mean, it took a long time, relatively.***

# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 7. Release early. Release ofen. And listen to your customers.

---
# *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

# 8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
