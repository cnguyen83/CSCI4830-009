# Project Name: 
FilmyBot - A Slack chatbot for getting movie information while communicating using Slack

# Project URL: 
https://github.com/SaishRedkar/FilmyBot

## Project done in contribution with Siddharth Pant

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
FilmyBot is an open source chat bot project and can be gotten up and running in a couple of minutes in your own Slack team. We have created this project using the official Slack API and the OMDB API.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
I have been interested in conversational UIs and more specifically chatbots recently. Because of the time we spent on Slack daily, we decided to try out building a Slack bot. Being my first open source project which matches my interest and programming language [Python], I feel it's a good place to begin.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
The number of Slack integrations and apps are on a rise and we plan to contribute to this rise. Currently, the FilmyBot is a userbot. Maybe, we can further plan to make this as a Slash Command by hosting it on a server and also make it interface with other APIs for a better utility and user experience.
