## Student Name: Chaitra Ramachandra
## Project Name: Traceroute
### Project URL: [link to github repo for Traceroute](https://github.com/ChaitraRp/traceroute)

Initially I wanted to contribute to python by fixing bugs. I have changed my plan and I have designed a tool to do  traceroute in Windows systems using the same commands as in Unix systems.

### Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
I have developed a tool that does the job of traceroute command found in UNIX like operating systems. This tool was developed in python and works similar to traceroute/host on Windows like operating system where these commands are not found. The project can be found in the GIT reppository and I have made it open to all.

### Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
I like how simple python language is to use and yet how extensive the libraries are! I wanted to learn more libraries in python by building new tools that are found in Unix systems but not found on Windows system. This project helped me in learning how network routing works in the backend.

### Why this contribution is meaningful to the others (1-3 sentences):
This tool works perfectly fine in tracing the route taken by the injected packets. There are lot of room for improvement. Currently, the tool can handle only max_hops and port number. There are other features than can be implemented. People who are fascinated about networks, can use this tool to learn what happens in the backend, what protocols are used in tracing a network packet, how udo and icmp sockets are created, how TTL works etc. This can be a useful learning tool.
