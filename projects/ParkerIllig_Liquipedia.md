## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
I reached out to the guy who runs Liquipedia about what I can do to help even though a significant amount of the project is in PHP. I told him I could work on some documentation, and he said he might also have some things in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for me to do. He will come back to me on March 6th about what I can be working on specifically.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
This last summer I worked on a lot of the initial set up for the fighting game (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Guilty Gear, etc.) wiki on Liquipedia. A problem with the fighting game community is that there is not any good conglomerate sources for player and tournament results. Over the summer, I created a lot of images & tournament result pages, but work on the fighters wiki died pretty quickly when we saw a lack of other contributors. 

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
I hope to work something that will make contributing easier to get into as that is a primary problem with this wiki in particular. A lot of Liquipedia is run by staff, but they still need community help to input the large amount of data that is necessary for communities like the FGC (Fighting Game Community), which spans decades.
