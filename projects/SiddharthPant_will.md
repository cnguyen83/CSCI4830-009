Project Name: will
Project URL: http://skoczen.github.io/will

Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
To add another functionality to will as a chatbot.

Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
This is my first open source project. Will seems like a good place to start as the documentation is very well
written which makes it easy to understand. It also doesn't have a lot of conventions as other projects like
atom which gives me some flexibility in the learning curve

Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
There hasn't been an update to will in quite some time during which a lot of things may have changed. Hopefully
at the end of project, will have a new functionality which is modern and meaningful to it.
