# Student Name: Ryan Riley  
# Project Name: Firefox
# Project URL: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):

I plan on fixing a bug or adding a relativively straightforward feature. Firefox is a large, active project so I should be able to find an appropriate path to contribute. Mozilla also has a team of mentors that are there to help guide new developers. 


## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):

Despite having several browser which function more reliably, I tend to use Firefox simply because it is open source. The other developers of browsers have somewhat dubious potential uses of personal data they can collect from usage. As such, I want Firefox to continue to be a viable product. 

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):

Firefox is buggy. It leaks a ton of memory and has a variety of other reliability issues. The project is absolutely huge and although there are many contributors, Firefox can use all of the help they can get. Patching a bug for them gives more senior developers time to work on other issues.
