## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
Originally I planned on working on an open source project called 'Zulip', which was an open source group message app.  Since I am not very comfortable contributing code to a codebase I am unfamilar with, I planned on contributing documentation.  However when I went to make this contribution, I found out that there wasn't currently any open documentation issues.  Not only this, but I realized that most of the documentation was in regard to obscure functionality that I myself was unfamilar with, and unsure how to get more familar with. I wasn't sure how to proceed, so I decided I wanted to change my project to a project I have been working on in github over the semester -- a basic school management system with object oriented design.  My contribution includes most base functionality of a school management system, as well as the ability to connect to an outside database, thus using persistent storage 

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
This project is meaningful not necissarily because of the project.  More so, the ability to gain experience working on an open source project in github, gaining valuable experience was what was meaningful.  Going into the job marken in a year or so, experience like this is crucial and irreplacable. 

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
This contribution should be meaninful because you can't have much of a management system without having persistent storage.  In making this work, I have added much value to the basic project.
