## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): Christina and I are going to create a Slackbot that can interact with the Pivotal Tracker API. The Slackbot can get stories' statuses and push updates.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): Our team for another class communicates over Slack, but we're required to track progress on Pivotal Tracker, so we want to be able to retrieve our current stories, create new stories, and assign owners to stories as we discuss them over slack.


## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): This contribution will be meaningful to the project because it will allow my teammates and I to have quick access to our Pivotal Tracker project account and provide a way to quickly translate our conversations into user stories.
