#### Project Name: 
>Fireasy: Java

#### Project URL: 
>  https://github.com/codytowstik/fireasyjava

#### Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
> Create wrapper methods for various firebase methods, or a combination of Firebase to achieve desired goals. Create a format that makes this project easy to contribute to.

#### Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
> At various hackathons and on personal projects, the majority of my time (whether with Node, Java, or Swift) has been spent on creating working authentication and efficient database transactions, among other Firebase functionality. Firebase documentation is often confusing and nonstandard throughout different languages. This will be the java version of these wrapper functions that make creating a desired effect easy, and combining methods to achieve complex results easy as well.

#### Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
> This is meaningful because it provides a base level project for others to contribute to. I have heard by many people that Firebase is not very intuitive, and this will hopefully allow for an intutitive approach, and easy to follow with provided documentation.
