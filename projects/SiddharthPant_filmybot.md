Project done in contribution with Saish Redkar

Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
FilmyBot is an open source chat bot project and can be gotten up and running in a couple of minutes in your own Slack team. We have created this project using the official Slack API and the OMDB API.

Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
This is my first open source project. I use slack quite a bit at work and while collaborating on projects. This project seems like a good place to start working on open source projects for something that I am familiar with. 

Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
The number of Slack integrations and apps are on a rise and we plan to contribute to this rise. Currently, the FilmyBot is a userbot. Maybe, we can further plan to make this as a Slash Command by hosting it on a server and also make it interface with other APIs for a better utility and user experience.
