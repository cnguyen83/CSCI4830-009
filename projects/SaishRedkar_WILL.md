# Project Name: Will - a Chatbot
# Project URL: https://github.com/skoczen/will

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
Will is an open source chat bot project and can be gotten up and running in a couple of minutes.
I plan on adding a meaningful plugin functionality to will.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
I have been interested in conversational UIs and more specifically chatbots recently. Being my first open source project which matches my interest and programming language [Python], I feel it's a good place to start. Also, some Slack bots are built taking Will as the base inspiration and it's documentation looks neat enough for a beginner like me. It also gives me an opportunity to work on an end to end chatbot implementation system.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
There hasn't been much work being done on Will and the last commit was way back in 2015.Also there are 40 unresolved issues out there. I look forward to understand Will's core system and provide some added useful functionality in the next 2 months.
