Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
I plan on contributing to publish a alexa skill using amazon web services. Amazon web services is great platform to learn more about cloud services and technologies involved with it. With this project, will be exposed to alexa skill kit and AWS lambda with java-script / node.js. It also helps me to understand basic design of alexa. So I believe by contributing to that I will learn more about amazon alexa skills, and get to publish one of it.

Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
Amazon web services is definitely a big service cloud environment, but I didnâ€™t have a chance to work on it yet. I would love to get more familiar with it through this project. Also, this project helps me to get hands on alexa skill kit and even publish one of my own skill. 

Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
Amazon alexa is growing and they want everyone to try and publish their own skills to expand the usage of it. With my contribution to this project, will have some technologies developed and published skills to present at the end of the semester.
