# Homework3 Submissions:

**Yogitha Renu Mahadasu**

**Option2:** I converted a program I wrote to learn RAFT distributed consensus algorithm into an open source project, because I do not control the course project repository and also as they already have great documentation - readme, contributing, license etc.

**Taylor Andrews**

**Option 2** Created repository CI-Practice for HW3 and HW4 as I don't control the project repo.
