# Why a BEIPA

#### Employees who feel they need to look over their shoulder and hide personal projects unrelated to the business are demotivated and set up for conflict.
#### You don't want to push out employees who feel they need to leave in order to work on a personal project unrelated to the business.
#### You don't want to keep employees who are staying only because they're uncertain whether they have the rights to leave and work on a project unrelated to the business full time.
#### You want to encourage employee learning through creation and contributions to their communities (e.g., through open source), unhindered by need for employer permission.
#### Controlling employee side projects unrelated to the business does not contribute to revenue or profit.

# Contract Patch by Fred Jennings

#### And almost all of the contracts were bad.

#### Not badly written, though some were. Not legally unenforceable, though some were.

#### They were bad for the people who signed them.

#### They waived important legal rights, gave the employer ownership of ideas and projects it had no reason to take, or imposed serious limits on future work.

#### And people often didn’t realize how bad these were, the risks they’d agreed to, or what rights they’d given up.

#### Among the few who did, most didn’t realize they could negotiate these terms. Others did, but weren’t sure how to start. Several assumed their employer wouldn’t enforce the more onerous terms.

#### Nobody should bet their future on that assumption. Doing so is to build one’s career on a house of cards.

# Once more about VI

## "both text editing and command operations can be performed without requiring the removal of the user's hands from the home row"

---
# Without VI, your hands leave the home row...

## To use a mouse to select text, commands, or menu items in a GUI editor.
## To the arrow keys or editing functions (Home / End or Function Keys).
## To invoke commands using modifier keys in conjunction with the standard typewriter keys.

# Kanban

## Kanban is Japanese for “visual signal” or “card.” Toyota line-workers used a kanban (i.e., an actual card) to signal steps in their manufacturing process. The system's highly visual nature allowed teams to communicate more easily on what work needed to be done and when.

# Kanban

## Lean approach to agile development
## Eliminate sprints: release each feature when ready
## Focus on features rather than groups of features
## One feature at a time: start to deployment
## Goal is to eliminate software inventory, aka: "waste"
## Limit work in progress

# Agile has Failed to Deliver

# Development and operations live in two silos, so getting software into the hands of users still takes too long.

# DevOps unifies security, development, and operations in an anti-fragile way.

## DevOps flips IT from resisting change to driving change and is the enabler for getting software out of the door and closing the loop between developer and customer.

# Technical benefits:

## Continuous delivery
## Less complex problems to fix
## Fewer failures
## Faster resolution of problems
## More time to focus on high-value features 

---
# Business benefits:

## Increased customer satisfaction
## Reduced cloud/server infrastructure costs
## Faster delivery of software features
## Increase in sales
## More stable operating environments

# "Teams that practice DevOps deploy 30x more frequently, have 60x fewer failures, and recover 160x faster."  — Puppet Labs 2016 State of DevOps Report
---
# "Infrastructure as code allowed us to perform 10x more builds without adding a single person to our team."  — Michael Knight, Build Engineer at Atlassian

---
# "DevOps has helped us do very frequent releases, giving us an edge on time to market. We are now able to make daily product releases as opposed to 6-month releases, and push fixes to our customers in a span of a few hours."  — Hamesh Chawla, VP of Engineering at Zephyr
---
# "Devops isn't any single person's job. It's everyone's job."  — Christophe Capel, Principal Product Manager, JIRA Service Desk

## DevOps Area 1: Extend Development into IT Operations

## Create the single “repository of truth” containing both the code and environments
## Create the one-step Dev, Test and Production environment build process
## Extend the deployment pipeline processes into production
## Define roles and integrate QA, Infosec, Ops/CAB into Dev workstream

---
# DevOps Area 2: Create IT Operations feedback into Development

## Make all infrastructure data visible
## Make all application data visible
## Modify the incident resolution process and blameless post-mortems
## Monitor the health of the deployment pipelines

---
# DevOps Area 3: Embed Development into IT Operations

## Make Dev initially responsible for their own services
## Return problematic services back to Dev
## Integrate Dev into the incident management processes
## Have Dev cross-train Ops

---
# DevOps Area 4: Embed IT Operations into Development

## Embed Ops knowledge and capabilities into Dev
## Design for IT Operations
## Institutionalize IT Operations knowledge
## Break things early and often
